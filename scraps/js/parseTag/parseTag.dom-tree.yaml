# Theoretical example that uses YAML to construct a DOM tree.
# Each array element is an object with a SINGLE property containing
# the 'parseable' tag string

---

# Use css selector syntax to indicate parent element to render into
'#container':

  - main.content:
      - h2#about.text-xl.mx-2.p-4|title="About": About Us
      - p.mx-2.p-4: Here's what we're about...
      - ul#stuff:
          - li: Doing cool stuff
          - li: Doing not-so-cool stuff
          - li: Doing terrible stuff

  # DANGEROUS!!! Possibly allow strings of JavaScript code to be passed to eval()?
  - script:
      - ___JS___: |
          const stuff_ = document.getElementById('stuff');
          stuff_.style.listStyleType = 'none';

  # The fragments cannot be processed by the parseTag() function
  # But are included as an example
  - <>:
      - p#fragments:
          - <>: Document fragments inside of a paragraph...
          - <>: ...inside of other document fragments.
      - p#more-fragments:
          - <>: Two more fragments inside of a paragraph...
          - <>: ...inside of other document fragments.
